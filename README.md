# Stable Roommates
Inheritance of matching problems based on the Stable Roommates. Project created for Master thesis in 2016.

## Description
The aim of this thesis is to verify theoretically and practically the relationships between stable matching problems in terms of inheritance. It contains an answer to the hypothesis posed by the author that matching problems support inheritance relationship. The thesis contains: an outline of the problem, description and implementation of the algorithms, which solve three kind of stable roommates problem (SR, SRT, SRI) and some results from analytic research conducted by the author. One of the main part of thesis contains a desktop application which is an implementation of the algorithms for solving stable roommates problems. Some computational results are also reported.
